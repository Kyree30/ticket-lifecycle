"Communication and working out the issue: For communication, everyone will be able to view the ticket to stay aware of what has already been done, and facilitators can also be involved. Working out the issue will be assigned to the department and the people who are within that department."
</p>
<br />
  <h1><b>Resolved</b></h1>
